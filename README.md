# ebayApp
A program related to an eBay store my family and I run. We wanted a way to keep track of a separate inventory apart from the one on eBay itself, so this program acheives that. This allows all of our products on eBay to be viewed and have their own quantity to be changed. All products are stored on the Products.csv file that must have the file path of the folder changed within the code.
# inputCode
Program used to quickly import all items into the csv file.
